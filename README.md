## 📘 Project Description
This project is a collection of **Java assignments** designed to practice and enhance problem-solving, algorithm development, and core programming skills.  
Each assignment focuses on different aspects of programming, such as **searching**, **sorting**, **string manipulation**, and **logical operations**, providing hands-on experience with Java fundamentals.

The tasks are structured to challenge **beginners and intermediate-level programmers**, preparing them for real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Before running the assignments, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** – Version 8 or higher  
  👉 [Download from Oracle’s Official Website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **Java IDE** – Any of the following:
  - IntelliJ IDEA  
  - Eclipse  
  - NetBeans

## 🧠 What I Have Done
This project includes solutions to various **Java programming assignments**, such as:

### 🔹 Search and Sorting Algorithms
- Find the 2nd highest CGPA  
- Binary Search implementation  
- Manual Sorting (without built-in sort methods)

### 🔹 Random Number Operations
- Generate random numbers  
- Find minimum and maximum values

### 🔹 Pattern Printing
- Print complex patterns using loops and conditionals

### 🔹 String Manipulations
- Count words, characters, vowels, and consonants  
- Remove vowels from strings  

### 🔹 Custom Algorithms
- Currency Note Breakdown  
- IP Address Validation  
- Binary String Verification  

### 🔹 HTML Parsing
- Extract transaction IDs using string operations

### 🔹 Password Generation
- Generate secure passwords with custom rules

### 🔹 Mathematical & Logical Operations
- Solve logical challenges like distributing question marks  
- Calculate product discounts  

All solutions are implemented **manually without relying on built-in shortcuts (e.g., `Arrays.sort()`)**, ensuring a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms.
